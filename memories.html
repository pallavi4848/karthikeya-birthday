  <img src="memory1.jpg" class="memory">
  <p>This was the first time we went boating at Tank Bund together.
I was so incredibly happy that day.
I’m always happy when I’m with you, no matter what we do…
but that day felt extra special and extra joyful.

  <p>WThis was the first mirror selfie we ever took together.
It was the day I removed my mask.
I was so happy, not just because of the moment…
but because I could see how happy you were.
I might forget many memories in life,
but I will never forget the adorable expressions you gave me that day
  </p>

  <img src="memory3.jpg" class="memory">
  <p>This was the first picture we took together without a mask.
Even though I hadn’t fully removed mine yet,
I could see how much you loved that smile…
and that made me cherish it even more.
I love this picture so much.
It will always be one of the most special and beautiful pictures of us ❤️
